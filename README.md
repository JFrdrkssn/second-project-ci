The purpose of the site is to provide a simple game for people to enjoy and spark feelings of nostalgia. Target audience is anyone looking to pass time.

## **User Experience (UX)**  
---  

- ### **User stories**  

      - As a User, I want it to be clear that the site is a browser game.
      - As a User, I want to intuitively understand how to operate the game.
      - As an Owner, I want the site to be clear and elicit positive emotions to encourage return visits.

- ### **Design**

    - **Colour Scheme**

        - A dark black and blue background coupled with bright grey, white and gold text provides clear contrast that is also easy on the eyes.
        - A large, bordered button with light blue and white text at the center of the page give users easy access and a visual cue to start the game.
        - Enemies are colored green and purple for easy recognition of their affiliation in the game.
        - Missiles are colored tan with a an orange center and bottom to imitate propulsion.
        - The player ship has light grey and white colors with a light blue center to imitate glass and orange dots at the bottom to imitate propulsion.
    
    - **Typography**

        - The Chakra Petch font is used for the game title and button. The font has a modern, almost futuristic, and strong look that lends itself well to the space battle theme.
        - The Changa font is used for text and score content. It has a similar style to the Chakra Petch font and blends in well without adding too much visual contrast.
        - Sans-serif is used as a backup-font.
